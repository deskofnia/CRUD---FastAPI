mongo_client â€“ A tool for connecting to MongoDB
ASCENDING â€“ Ascending sort order
settings â€“ For accessing the environment variables

We evoked the .MongoClient() method with the database connection URL in the above code to create a connection pool to the MongoDB database. Calling the .MongoClient() method returns a client object with a bunch of methods that we can use to access and manage the MongoDB instance.

Next, we created the database with client["enter_database_name"] , added a collection with the name notes and created a unique index on the title field. The unique index will ensure that no two documents in the collection end up with the same title.
